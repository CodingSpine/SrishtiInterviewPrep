1. How do we redirect to another webpage?
	window.location = url; and window.location.href = url; How are they different? 
	// similar behavior as an HTTP redirect
	window.location.replace("http://stackoverflow.com");

	// similar behavior as clicking on a link
	window.location.href = "http://stackoverflow.com";	

	window.location.replace(...) is better than using window.location.href, because replace() does not keep the originating page in the session history, meaning the user won't get stuck in a never-ending back-button fiasco.
